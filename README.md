# Jyunioni-app-server
PHP codes for the Event fetching to be done in an Apache server.

These PHP classes handle fetching and parsing the events data into .txt files which are then retrieved into the app locally. In the app the .txt file contents are parsed into Event objects. 

For more documentation about the project see the [main repository](https://github.com/januzgi/Jyunioni-app/tree/master/app/src/main "Jyunioni main repository").
